# Android MVVM + Clean Architecture + Kotlin
 
This repository contains a sample app skeleton that implements **MVVM + Clean architecture in Kotlin** along with **Dagger, Room, RxJava2 and Retrofit**.
 
Using this combination of MVVM + Clean architecture enhances the separation of concerns with modular approach.
 
**Plug and play this skeleton to build great apps in Kotlin ;)**
